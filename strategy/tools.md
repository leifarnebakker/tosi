## Swot analysis

### Summary

**SWOT analysis** \(or **SWOT matrix**\) is a strategic planning technique used to help a person or organization identify strengths, weaknesses, opportunities, and threats related to [business](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Business)competition or project planning. It is intended to specify the objectives of the business venture or project and identify the internal and external factors that are favorable and unfavorable to achieving those objectives. Users of a SWOT analysis often ask and answer questions to generate meaningful information for each category to make the tool useful and identify their competitive advantage. SWOT has been described as the tried-and-true tool of strategic analysis.

Strengths and weakness are frequently internally-related, while opportunities and threats commonly focus on the external environment. The name is an acronym for the four parameters the technique examines:

* **S**trengths: characteristics of the business or project that give it an advantage over others.
* **W**eaknesses: characteristics of the business that place the business or project at a disadvantage relative to others.
* **O**pportunities: elements in the environment that the business or project could exploit to its advantage.
* **T**hreats: elements in the environment that could cause trouble for the business or project.
